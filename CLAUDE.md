# Stomatology Practice Management System

## Project Overview
A Django-based web application for managing a dental practice with patient visit tracking and dynamic visualization of 6 key health indicators using hexagonal radar charts.

## Key Features
- Patient management system
- 6 configurable health indicators per patient
- Hexagonal radar chart visualization with color zones (green/yellow/red)
- Historical data overlay with semi-transparent layers (wind rose effect)
- Date-based filtering with "show on diagram" checkboxes
- Manual indicator configuration (min/max values, zones)

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django + Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Docker container)
- **Frontend:** Django templates + Chart.js/D3.js for radar charts
- **Containerization:** Docker + docker-compose

## Memories
- Use `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.1/dist/chart.umd.js"></script>` for chart inclusion

## Database Structure
### Core Models
- `Patient` - Patient information
- `Indicator` - Configurable indicators (name, min/max values, color zones)
- `Measurement` - Patient measurements with timestamps and visibility flags

## Development Environment
- PostgreSQL in Docker container
- Django development server
- Data persistence via Docker volumes
