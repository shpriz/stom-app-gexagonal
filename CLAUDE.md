# Stomatology Practice Management System

## Project Overview
A Django-based web application for managing a dental practice with patient visit tracking and dynamic visualization of 6 key health indicators using hexagonal radar charts.

## Key Features
- Patient management system
- 6 configurable health indicators per patient
- Hexagonal radar chart visualization with color zones (green/yellow/red)
- Historical data overlay with semi-transparent layers (wind rose effect)
- Date-based filtering with "show on diagram" checkboxes
- Manual indicator configuration (min/max values, zones)

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django + Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Docker container)
- **Frontend:** Django templates + Chart.js/D3.js for radar charts
- **Containerization:** Docker + docker-compose

## Memories
- Use `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.1/dist/chart.umd.js"></script>` for chart inclusion
- **CRITICAL**: Always use unified CSS framework from `/static/css/modern-medical.css` - Complete design system for consistent styling across ALL pages
- **NEVER** create custom CSS files or use inline styles - everything must use modern-medical.css classes

## UI Design System Rules (MANDATORY)
### Page Structure
- **ALWAYS** use unified header: `<header class="header">` with `<div class="container">` and `<div class="header-content">`
- **ALWAYS** use `<div class="container">` for page content
- **ALWAYS** wrap content in `<div class="card"><div class="card-body">`
- **NEVER** use old page-header, hero-section, or main-container structures

### Navigation
- Use standard nav structure with: üè† –ü–∞–Ω–µ–ª—å —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è, üë• –í—Å–µ –ø–∞—Ü–∏–µ–Ω—Ç—ã, ‚öôÔ∏è –ù–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–∏, üìã –°—Ö–µ–º—ã, üö™ –í—ã—Ö–æ–¥
- Mark active page with `nav-link active` class
- Logout button uses `btn btn-danger btn-sm`

### Buttons (CRITICAL - Follow Exactly)
- **Edit actions**: `btn btn-warning` (orange #F59E0B with border)
- **Add/Create actions**: `btn btn-success` (green)  
- **Delete actions**: `btn btn-danger` (red)
- **Cancel actions**: `btn btn-secondary` (gray)
- **Button spacing**: Use `d-flex gap-2 justify-content-end mt-4` for button groups

### Form Fields
- **Input borders**: Light blue #a8c5f0 with hover effects (#7ba7e8)
- Use `form-group` class for field containers
- Use `help-text` class for field descriptions
- Required fields marked with `<span class="required">*</span>`

### Language
- **ALL** interface text must be in Russian
- Use "–ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å" instead of "–∏–Ω–¥–∏–∫–∞—Ç–æ—Ä"
- Use professional medical terminology

### Layout Consistency
- Page headers use `patients-header-combined` structure
- Remove unnecessary banners and redundant navigation elements
- Keep interfaces clean and focused
- Use consistent spacing with mt-4, gap-2 classes

## Database Structure
### Core Models
- `Patient` - Patient information
- `Indicator` - Configurable indicators (name, min/max values, color zones)
- `Measurement` - Patient measurements with timestamps and visibility flags

## Development Environment
- PostgreSQL in Docker container
- Django development server
- Data persistence via Docker volumes
